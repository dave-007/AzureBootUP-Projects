# AzureBootUP Projects
This repo is a supplement to the [AzureBootUP project](https://github.com/KonTheCat/AzureBootUP). 

This repository will be forked by students to their own repository from GitHub. They can follow the instructions on GitHub to clone the repo to their own computer.

Student can run `git pull` before working on the next weeks assignment  to ensure they are working with the latest version.

When week's work is complete and files saved, student can run `git add .` from the project root to add all files to the next commit, and then run `git commit -m "Commit message goes here" ` to commit the work to their local repository.

Student can then save the work back to their own GitHub repository via `git push` with the results of each week's homework in the form of scripts, templates and markdown files in the appropriate folder for the week.
